# Week-10-11
I deployed the dionaea honeypot using the MHN application.
# Issues
I bad many issues trying to get the google cloud wroking since I had never used it before. I also had ALOT of problems trying to get the firewall settings. Afte rnermerous hours of reaserch i fianally got everything up and running. By that time i needd to head home for break. THis is ware I encountered my larggest problem. At my home we have satalite intenet witch i feel like may have skewed my resluts. I was only able to get the attacks I initiated myself. IT took me 3 hours and 30 minutes to get 6 attacks to go thru. I also had a problem getting the session data i ran the command it it came back saying it couldnt identify the session.
# Data
Although I had skewed results I researched what my results should have been. I would have seen that port 23 is the most common port to attack. I would have also see that most attacks are coming from the US and China.
Althoug only being able to get 6 results at my home i was able to get 89 attacks before Isb left. I would have loved to be able to of left it up longer in order to get better results.
Overall my honey pot ran for around 3-5 hours.
